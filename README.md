Simulations: 

Why are we actually interested in simulation? Simulations of quantum systems can help examine properties, structure, and behaviour of something like a molecule. This way they can help us, for example, develop new and more efficient materials for batteries leading to more efficient mobility. Understand the chemical processes involved in the process of fertilizer production could support finding a process that uses way less energy. And for drug research, scientists would be able to investigate these drugs without actually creating them in a lab synthetically.

And why is simulating something like a molecule so hard to do? Molecules are made up of atoms like Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N) and so on. Those atoms are themselves made up of protons, neutrons and electrons. In order to simulate a molecule, we need to think about every single electron, their position, their interaction among each other and any forces acting on the molecule. Storing all of this requires a huge amount of computer memory
"Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical. 
Richard Feynman (1981), physicist and Nobel Prize laureate (1965)
