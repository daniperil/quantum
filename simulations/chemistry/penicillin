Penicillin (C16H18N2O4S) is used as an antibiotics for infections. It does not only look complex, it would also require 
10^86 bits to simulate classicaly.

And even simulating penicillin, which would require more bits than there are atoms in the observable universe, would be possible with 286 qubit
